abstract = {This is a lively textbook providing a solid introduction to financial option valuation for undergraduate students armed with a working knowledge of a first year calculus. Written in a series of short chapters, its self-contained treatment gives equal weight to applied mathematics, stochastics and computational algorithms. No prior background in probability, statistics or numerical analysis is required. Detailed derivations of both the basic asset price model and the Black-Scholes equation are provided along with a presentation of appropriate computational techniques including binomial, finite differences and in particular, variance reduction techniques for the Monte Carlo method. Each chapter comes complete with accompanying stand-alone MATLAB code listing to illustrate a key idea. Furthermore, the author has made heavy use of figures and examples, and has included computations based on real stock market data.},

abstract = {This book provides a first, basic introduction into the valuation of financial options via the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). It provides readers with an easily accessible text explaining main concepts, models, methods and results that arise in this approach. In keeping with the series style, emphasis is placed on intuition as opposed to full rigor, and a relatively basic understanding of mathematics is sufficient. The book provides a wealth of examples, and ample numerical experiments are givento illustrate the theory. The main focus is on one-dimensional financial PDEs, notably the Black-Scholes equation. The book concludes with a detailed discussion of the important step towards two-dimensional PDEs in finance.},

abstract = {The remarkable performance of deep learning is based on its ability to learn high-level features by processing large amounts of data. This exceptionally superior performance has attracted the attention of researchers studying option pricing. However, option data are more expensive and less accessible than other types of data and are imbalanced because of the liquidity of options. This motivated us to propose a new option pricing and delta-hedging framework called DeepOption. This framework, which is based on deep learning, can improve the performance even when applying imbalanced real option data. In particular, the framework fuses simulated big data, known as distilled data, obtained using various traditional parametric methods. The proposed model employs the following three-stage training approach: Our model is pre-trained using big distilled data after it is fine-tuned using real option data through transfer learning. Finally, a delta branch is added to the model and trained. We experimentally evaluated the proposed method using three sets of real option data, namely S&P 500 European call options, EuroStoxx50 call options, and Hang Seng Index put options. Our experimental results on option pricing demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms parametric methods and other machine learning methods. Specifically, our model, which uses pre-training with distilled data, reduces the overall mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) by more than 50\%, compared with that of a deep learning model using only real option data without pre-training.}

ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes a data-driven approach, by means of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), to value financial options and to calculate implied volatilities with the aim of accelerating the corresponding numerical methods. With ANNs being universal function approximators, this method trains an optimized ANN on a data set generated by a sophisticated financial model, and runs the trained ANN as an agent of the original solver in a fast and efficient way. We test this approach on three different types of solvers, including the analytic solution for the Black-Scholes equation, the COS method for the Heston stochastic volatility model and Brent&rsquo;s iterative root-finding method for the calculation of implied volatilities. The numerical results show that the ANN solver can reduce the computing time significantly.},

    abstract = { Here we develop an option pricing method for European options based on the Fourier-cosine series and call it the COS method. The key insight is in the close relation of the characteristic function with the series coefficients of the Fourier-cosine expansion of the density function. In most cases, the convergence rate of the COS method is exponential and the computational complexity is linear. Its range of application covers underlying asset processes for which the characteristic function is known and various types of option contracts. We will present the method and its applications in two separate parts. The first one is this paper, where we deal with European options in particular. In a follow-up paper we will present its application to options with early-exercise features. }
